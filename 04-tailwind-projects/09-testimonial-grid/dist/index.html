                        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I
                        learned were current, industry-relevant, and geared
                        towards practical work. I honestly feel I got my money's

                        I was an EMT for many years before I joined the
                        bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and
                        have heard some people who had an amazing experience
                        here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
                        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly. The next 12 weeks
                        was the best - and most grueling - time of my life .
                        Since completing the course, I've successfully switched
                        careers, and I'm now working as a Software Engineer at a
                        VR startup.
